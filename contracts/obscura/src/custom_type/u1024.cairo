//! # U1024 - 1024-bit Unsigned Integer Implementation
//!
//! This module provides a custom implementation of a 1024-bit unsigned integer type
//! for cryptographic operations in the Obscura privacy-preserving system.
//!
//! ## Implementation Details
//!
//! The U1024 type is implemented as a struct containing eight 128-bit limbs:
//! - `limb0` through `limb7`: Individual 128-bit components
//! - Total size: 8 Ã— 128 = 1024 bits
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! U1024 is designed for cryptographic operations that require:
//! - Extended precision beyond standard 256-bit integers
//! - Large number arithmetic for zero-knowledge proofs
//! - Cryptographic calculations requiring 1024-bit precision
//!
//! ## Note
//!
//! This is a basic structure definition. Full arithmetic operations
//! would need to be implemented for complete functionality.

/// A 1024-bit unsigned integer implementation for cryptographic operations.
///
/// This struct represents a large integer by storing it as eight 128-bit limbs,
/// enabling operations on values that exceed the standard 256-bit limit.
///
/// # Fields
/// - `limb0` through `limb7`: Individual 128-bit components of the number
///
/// # Structure
/// The number is stored in little-endian format:
/// - `limb0`: Least significant 128 bits
/// - `limb7`: Most significant 128 bits
///
/// # Usage
/// This type is primarily used for:
/// - Cryptographic operations requiring extended precision
/// - Zero-knowledge proof calculations
/// - Large number arithmetic in privacy-preserving systems
